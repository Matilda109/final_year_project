# Dashboard Statistics Fix

## The Problem

The admin dashboard was showing zero values for student and supervisor counts, even though there were users in the system. This was happening because:

1. The Supabase count query wasn't working as expected
2. The code was trying to access the count through `data.count` instead of the direct `count` property
3. The relationships table might not have been set up correctly

## The Solution

I've made the following changes to fix the issue:

1. **Fixed the Dashboard Count Queries**:
   - Updated the count queries to use the correct format
   - Added multiple fallback methods to ensure counts are always retrieved
   - Improved error handling with detailed error messages

2. **Created SQL Setup for Relationships**:
   - Added a SQL script (`SUPABASE_RELATIONSHIPS_SETUP.sql`) to create the necessary tables and views
   - Created views to make it easier to query relationship data
   - Added RLS policies to secure the data

## How to Implement

1. **Update the Dashboard Code**:
   - The dashboard-tab.tsx file has been updated with the new counting logic
   - The interface has been updated to match the actual data structure

2. **Run the SQL Setup Script**:
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Open the SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste the contents of `SUPABASE_RELATIONSHIPS_SETUP.sql`
   - Run the script to create the necessary tables and views

## Testing

After implementing these changes:

1. Log in to the admin dashboard
2. Check if the statistics now show the correct counts
3. If not, check the browser console for any error messages
4. Verify that the tables and views exist in your Supabase database

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check the Database Schema**:
   - Verify that the `profiles` table has users with the correct `user_type` values
   - Make sure the `student_supervisor_relationships` table exists
   - Check that the views are created correctly

2. **Check for Console Errors**:
   - Open your browser's developer tools
   - Look for any error messages in the console
   - Pay attention to any Supabase query errors

3. **Verify Data Exists**:
   - Run the following SQL in the Supabase SQL Editor to check counts:
   ```sql
   SELECT user_type, COUNT(*) FROM profiles GROUP BY user_type;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM student_supervisor_relationships;
   ```

4. **Reset the Dashboard**:
   - Try refreshing the page or logging out and back in
   - Clear your browser cache if needed
